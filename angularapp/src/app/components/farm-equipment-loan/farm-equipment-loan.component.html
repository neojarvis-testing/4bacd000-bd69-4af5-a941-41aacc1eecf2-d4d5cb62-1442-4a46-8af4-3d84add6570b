        Farm equipment loans assist farmers in purchasing machinery like tractors, harvesters, and irrigation tools essential for modern farming. These loans typically cover up to 80-90% of the equipment's cost and offer flexible repayment options, usually spanning 3-7 years. Interest rates vary by lender, with subsidies available under specific government schemes to reduce the financial burden. To qualify, farmers need to demonstrate land ownership or agricultural activity, along with basic documentation like income proof and land records.
