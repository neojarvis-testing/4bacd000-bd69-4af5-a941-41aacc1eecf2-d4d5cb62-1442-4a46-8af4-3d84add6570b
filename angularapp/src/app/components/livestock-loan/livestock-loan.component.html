        Livestock loans are financial products designed to support farmers in purchasing and maintaining animals like cattle, poultry, or goats for agricultural purposes. These loans typically cover expenses such as feed, shelter, and veterinary care. Borrowers can benefit from flexible repayment options, often aligned with the income cycle of their livestock business. Interest rates and loan amounts vary by lender, with government schemes sometimes offering subsidies to reduce costs. Eligibility usually requires proof of farming activity and basic documentation like land records or income proof.
