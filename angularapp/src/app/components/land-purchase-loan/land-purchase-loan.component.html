        Land purpose loans, also known as plot loans, are designed to help individuals purchase land for residential or investment purposes. These loans typically cover up to 70-90% of the land's market value, depending on the lender. The repayment tenure usually ranges from 10 to 20 years, offering flexibility to borrowers. Interest rates vary, often linked to the lender's base rate, and some banks provide special schemes for salaried or self-employed individuals. Eligibility criteria include proof of income, identity, and land-related documents.
